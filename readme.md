We will be working with a design pattern called MVC. Its a neat way of separating parts of our app and grouping them based on their functionality and role. M stands for models, this will include all the code for our database models (which in this case will be Products). Then comes the V which stands for the views or the layout. We will not cover the views in this tutorial as we are designing an API. The remaining part now is the C, which stands for controllers which is the logic of how the app handles the incoming requests and outgoing responses. There will be one more thing, called Routes, Routes are our guide, they tell the client (browser/mobile app) to go to which Controller once a specific url/path is requested.
